# womp Team Contract

Our team will follow these guiding ideas:

* Don't write bad code.
> Bad code leads to more bad code. Slow down, plan things out, and refactor as you go.

* Make your own branch
> Feel free to make even more branches for specific features.

* Never push to master
> Make pull requests instead. Let a teammate merge your pull request. Also, pull before you pull request. 

* Communicate with the team
> Everyone's busy. If you can't make a deadline, let the team know so you can either 1) get more time or 2) have a team member cover
Red Flags 

* Each team member is given one (and only one) Red Flag. 
> They can use the Red Flag at any time to raise an important question, comment, etc. that the entire team must at least entertain. 

* Check Slack all the time.
> Like your life depends on it
