Project Plan
===================
Write your project plan in a single file, PLAN.md, that describes the program modules each team member plans to take primary and secondary responsibility for and a high-level plan of how the team will complete the program. Specifically, each person should take responsibility for specific features they intend to work on during the first sprint (core features) and during the second sprint (extensions).
